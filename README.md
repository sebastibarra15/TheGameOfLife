# TheGameOfLife
2020 project about Conway's Game of Life using Python and Tkinter, allowing users to interact with a dynamic grid, explore predefined patterns, and control the simulation's speed, pause, or reset. It visualizes complex cellular automaton behaviors and pays tribute to John Horton Conway's legacy in mathematics and computing.
